<b>History</b>
<p>
It all began with a dream—a vision to build a medical center capable of meeting the growing healthcare needs of the Social Security Organization’s insured population. In the mid-1970s, this dream took shape, and the initial design for Milad Hospital was laid out. The goal was to create a facility that would not only be modern and well-equipped but also stand as a symbol of healthcare equity in Iran.
Yet history rarely follows a straight path. With the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the onset of the Iran-Iraq War, the project—once a beacon of progress—fell into years of silence and suspension. A half-built structure stood quietly in the heart of Tehran, waiting for the day it would come to life.
Years passed. The war ended, and the country entered a phase of reconstruction. In 1988, attention returned to the dormant structure. Construction resumed with renewed hope and national determination. Engineers, physicians, managers, and workers joined forces to turn the unfinished dream into reality.
Finally, in July 2001, Milad Hospital came to life. Its doors opened, beds were prepared, and the first patients arrived. With a capacity of 1,000 beds and equipped with cutting-edge technology, the hospital was ready to serve millions of insured individuals.
But the story didn’t end there. Over time, the hospital’s service quality, breadth of specialties, and scientific reputation transformed it into a destination for all. Today, Milad Hospital is not just a healthcare facility—it is part of the collective memory of Iran’s health system, a lasting symbol of resilience, commitment, and hope.
